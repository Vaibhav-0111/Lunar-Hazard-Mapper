# **App Name**: Lunar Hazard Mapper

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Feature Detection: Automated detection algorithm utilizes AI/ML models to detect landslides and boulders from Chandrayaan imagery.
- Multi-Temporal Image Visualization: Display multi-temporal lunar images to detect changes over time and identify new geological activity.
- 3D Surface Model Generation: Convert 2D lunar data into 3D surface models using photoclinometry integration.
- Shadow and Slope Analysis: Use a tool that isolates shadow and slope-based features to differentiate between natural terrain and displaced mass, enhancing detection accuracy.
- Chandrayaan Data Integration: Display integrated data from ISRO's Chandrayaan missions to ensure high resolution and relevance.
- AI-Enhanced Geological Reasoning: Geological reasoning module to correlate extracted features to create risk zone mapping, enhanced by LLM contextual analysis tool.
- Risk Zone Web Dashboard: Interactive map dashboard to visualize identified risk zones with overlaid features.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#243A73) evoking the lunar night sky. It lends a scientific, sophisticated feel while staying far from Earth-tones such as greens and browns, to distinguish the UI visually.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated blue-gray (#222831), consistent with a dark color scheme that reinforces the theme of observing in darkness. Chosen to work well with image overlays.
- Accent color: Pale yellow (#E2DCC4), as it is analogous to blue, yet differs from it greatly in brightness, and evokes a neutral, scientific visual styling.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent different types of lunar features and risk factors.
- Prioritize a clean and intuitive layout to ensure effective visualization of complex geospatial data.
- Incorporate subtle animations to highlight key data points and changes detected in multi-temporal images.
